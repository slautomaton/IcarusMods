Ver 1.1 thru w203.

Description: Changed several things to make the difficulty almost trivial for those with busy schedules, short of directly giving yourself an arbitrary amount of mission rewards.

Unlimited Solar - Solar panels supply 25000 power units and remain active/on regardless of position. 
Free Respecs - Talent Respecs no longer cost anything.
Mission Rewards and XP Multiplier - Campaign mission rewards and exp granted increased by 60x. Open world mission rewards generally increased by times 100. In-game chore xp is generally 3x more (crafting, chopping, mining, cooking)
Infinite Stamina - Applies to character, and the mounts: moa, horse, and buffalo
World Bosses - Increased cave worm boss spawn count to 5 (the max) from 3. Increase alpha wolf spawn count to 7-9 (max is 17) on the Olympus map.
Stack Sizes - Inventory stacks increased by 10x or 100x for items. 
Talents Reworked - LuckStrike and Lumberjacks talent rate at 100% not 1%. Solo Talent health and damage buffs increased for max survivability, short of immortality.
